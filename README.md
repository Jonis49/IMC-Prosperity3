This repository documents our approach to the 2025 IMC Prosperity 3 algorithmic trading competition — a multi-round challenge involving over 12,000 global teams. The task: design profit-maximizing strategies across a growing set of synthetic assets, each emulating real-world market opportunities such as market making, ETF arbitrage, options pricing, and cross-exchange inefficiencies. Our final submission placed **6th globally**, driven by a systematic approach to extracting statistical edge and managing execution risk.

In each round, teams deployed autonomous trading scripts to interact with live order books in real time — quoting, hedging, and managing inventory to extract PnL under tight latency constraints. Finding edge was fundamentally a quantitative challenge: it required modeling step distributions, identifying statistical asymmetries, and validating insights through rigorous data analysis and simulation.

What follows is a breakdown of that process — asset by asset.
