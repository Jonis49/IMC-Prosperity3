# WHAT'S THE IMPACT

<summary>INTRODUCTION</summary>

This repository contains my write-up for the IMC Trading Competition.  
The focus is on modeling and evaluating statistical arbitrage strategies across five tradables:  
**Rainforest Resin**, **Kelp**, **Baskets**, **Volcanic Rocks**, and **Macarons**.

All analyses are driven by simulations, empirical distributions, dynamic programming, and range-based triggers.
