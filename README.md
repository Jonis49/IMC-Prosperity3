This repository outlines our submission to the 2025 IMC Prosperity 3 algorithmic trading competition — a global event that attracted over 12,000 teams. The challenge unfolded over five rounds, with new products and complexities introduced every three days. In each round, teams submitted autonomous trading scripts designed to maximize PnL in a variety of synthetic markets that mirrored real-world dynamics such as market making, ETF and options trading, cross-exchange trading, and counterparty-based trading.

After a slow start in the early rounds, we made a strong comeback and ultimately placed **6th globally**. We attribute this result to a combination of tight collaboration, extensive data analysis, and disciplined quantitative modeling. While the specifics varied across products, our overall approach was grounded in mathematical rigor and empirical validation.

What follows is a breakdown of that process — asset by asset.
